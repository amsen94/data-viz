## Comparison of Canada and USA General Government Debt, 1995-2021
This chart depicts the debt-to-GDP ratios of Canada compared to the US. This data shows that the Canadian debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds the US debt-to-GDP ratio until 2007.

## Different Visualizations
The three visualizations are distinctly different. While the first bar chart shows the general government for the OECD's member countries in 2020, it doesn't paint a full picture. The bar chart doesn't give the audience an understanding of the change in debt-to-GDP ratio over time for each country. The second visualization, which uses the [same data](https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Y2j) from the OECD, depicts the trends in either increases or decreases of government debt over time using sparklines. Since the data is pulled for 1995-2021, not each country depicts the same length of time, as each country doesn't report that data, thus making this an incomplete understanding of the change in government debt over time. 

I chose to compare the change in debt-to-GDP ratios between Canada and the US, as they both have data from 1995-2021, and since they are from the same region, I thought it would be interesting to see their comparable change over time. After cleaning the original data to only focus on Canada and the US, I chose to use an area chart to show the overlap between the two countries. The area chart takes the important features of the bar chart and line chart, and emphasizes important trends. Using complementary colors, blue for the US and yellow for Canada, the graph shows that the Canadian debt-to-GDP ratio exceeded that of the US until 2007. I chose yellow and blue as they are complementary colors, versus blue and red, as I was originally planning to, which may have been confusing, potentially denoting political parties instead of countries. The buttons at the top left of the graph can also be toggled to isolate the specific data for Canada and the US if the user would like to see an individual country's data.
