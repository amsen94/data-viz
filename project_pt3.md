# The Final Data Story

The initial story that I was researching evolved fairly dramatically given the limited data available, as well as the feedback I was given through my individual interviews. The original narrative I had was going to speak specifically to South Asian women+ who may be suffering from this condition or who may have symptoms but no specific diagnosis. However, I spoke to a diverse group of people who are not all South Asian, and realized that this condition is far more prevalent across various groups of women+. As the story was shaped, the data also supported this finding. 

# Changes Made Since Part II
As discussed in Part II, I took a lot of the feedback I received in my Wireframe and implemented it into my final presentation. In particular, I focused on making sure my presentation looked cohesive and thematic throughout by using dark red as my primary theme color, and building the rest of the look from there (e.g. the color palette included many dark reds and black in both the fonts and images). Additionally, I made sure to highlight pertinent parts of my visualizations to emphasize specific parts of my story. For instance, I made sure to highlight that though lower BMIs only comprise a third of all insulin-resistant cases for PCOS diagnoses, that is why the treatment advice of weight loss is not necessarily pertinent for this group of people. 

Additionally, I changed the sequence of my previous storyboard to help the story flow from a more specific case to an understanding of the condition as a whole. I also changed some of my visualizations by taking out extraneous detail that didn’t necessarily add to the narrative. For instance, in my initial symptoms tree map, I had a breakdown of the top symptoms by the top five countries reporting PCOS diagnoses. While I think this is still an interesting breakdown, I decided to move that to my appendix, and simply focus on the overall top-reported symptoms as it flowed with the story better. Similarly, I took out the breakdown of BMI and age-related breakdowns of PCOS diagnoses by race, and simply focused on overall PCOS diagnoses by race as it looked distracting.

Lastly, in order to bolster the claim that PCOS research is underfunded, I added a visualization showing the funding of other conditions with similar degrees of morbidity compared to funding for PCOS. I believe that the outcome of that visualization is quite compelling, and helps lead to my call to action.  

## The Audience

My intended audience was initially for South Asian women+ and those who are already diagnosed with PCOS. However, as I spoke to more people about their understanding of PCOS, I realized that while many had heard the term “PCOS,” most did not know what it stood for or what it was, just that it is a condition that disproportionately affects fertility. What many people did not know, including myself, is that, despite the misgivings of the name, PCOS does not necessarily mean that those diagnosed have cysts on their ovaries, but rather excessive follicles that are visible in the ovaries. 

As my research continued, I realized that this was an opportunity to really highlight the inadequate information and research available for this condition. As a result, my audience became more of a general awareness campaign, with an eventual call to action to encourage a general audience to reach out to their congressperson, and urge them to push for more PCOS research funding.

# Final Thoughts 

This topic has become very important to me, and though I don’t have a public health or medical background, I believe that every person deserves to have as much information and options as possible for conditions that affect their everyday health. PCOS is one of many conditions that disproportionately affect women+ but do not have the same level of funding or research as conditions that primarily affect men or the larger population. As I read through the literature and came across convoluted medical jargon, I realized that in order for me to provide awareness of this condition, I had to connect with a general audience. While it was important to keep some of the medical language, I did my best to explain why PCOS is so detrimental in as plain language as possible. I believe this was still effective in both explaining the severity of the condition, as well as staying relevant in the audiences’ minds after the presentation.
