# Wireframes

I decided to make the wireframe outline in Shorthand so I could have a better understanding of how my project is shaping up given the story that I’m trying to present as well as to have more familiarity with the tool. I have used some of the visualizations I presented in Part 1, but I’ve updated them more to flow better with the story, as well as to better represent the data I’ve collected. I realized after Part I that the scope of my story was a little too narrow, so rather than focusing on the effects of PCOS on the South Asian Diaspora, I am now focusing on PCOS in the context of the US, and highlighting that Women+ of color* represent the majority of diagnosed cases in the US. 

*Women+ is to indicate that this condition affects menstruating women and menstruating people who do not identify with the gender binary. 

# User Research

## Target Audience
The intended audience for this storyboard is predominantly those of menstruating age who may be dealing with many of the identified symptoms but aren’t currently diagnosed or are diagnosed but are unaware of the potential further medical implications beyond infertility. Many of us who are diagnosed are simply told that infertility is the biggest concern when it comes to a PCOS diagnosis, but aren’t necessarily aware that there’s a propensity toward insulin resistance. 

I decided to reach out to people I know who have either been diagnosed with PCOS or have heard of PCOS to get the range of understanding regarding the visual story. For those who have been diagnosed with PCOS, it was important to me to get their feedback regarding both the authenticity of the story told as well as anything that they might not necessarily know about their diagnosis. For those who have heard of PCOS but either don’t have a diagnosis or are unfamiliar with the illness beyond the basics, I wanted to get their interpretations of the visualizations, and whether they found anything confusing or surprising?
