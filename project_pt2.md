# Wireframes

Access my Shorthand preview [HERE](https://preview.shorthand.com/9EQg3QJclULxpkUR).

I decided to make the wireframe outline in Shorthand so I could have a better understanding of how my project is shaping up given the story that I’m trying to present as well as to have more familiarity with the tool. I have used some of the visualizations I presented in Part 1, but I’ve updated them more to flow better with the story, as well as to better represent the data I’ve collected. I realized after Part I that the scope of my story was a little too narrow, so rather than focusing on the effects of PCOS on the South Asian Diaspora, I am now focusing on PCOS in the context of the US, raising awareness of the symptoms of PCOS on women+*, and common misunderstandings of the illness that have led to little research in the medical field as well as underfunding from non-profit and government entities. 

*Women+ is to indicate that this condition affects menstruating women and menstruating people who do not identify with the gender binary. 

# User Research

## Target Audience
The intended audience for this storyboard is predominantly those of menstruating age who may be dealing with many of the identified symptoms but aren’t currently diagnosed or are diagnosed but are unaware of the potential further medical implications beyond infertility. Many of us who are diagnosed are simply told that infertility is the biggest concern when it comes to a PCOS diagnosis, but aren’t necessarily aware that there’s a propensity toward insulin resistance. 

I decided to reach out to people I know who have either been diagnosed with PCOS or have heard of PCOS to get the range of understanding regarding the visual story. For those who have been diagnosed with PCOS, it was important to me to get their feedback regarding both the authenticity of the story told as well as anything that they might not necessarily know about their diagnosis. For those who have heard of PCOS but either don’t have a diagnosis or are unfamiliar with the illness beyond the basics, I wanted to get their interpretations of the visualizations, and whether they found anything confusing or surprising. 


# Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|I want to understand how their understanding or personal experience with PCOS may influence how they view this topic.| 1. Do you know what PCOS is, and if so, what is your understanding of the implications of PCOS (there is no need to disclose personal medical details unless you feel comfortable doing so).|
|Considering their background, I trust these reviewers to give their honest opinion about how effective they find the narrative, or what is true to their experience. |2. In this storyboard, what did you like or find effective about this wireframe story? Why?|
|Similarly to the previous question, if I'm narrating a story that represents a part of my reviewers, I want to make sure the story and facts are correct and representative of them.|3. Is there anything you didn’t like. What and why?|
|For narrative's sake, I want to make sure that the storyline and the supporting evidence flow well and makes sense to any audience.|4.	Is there anything that was confusing about the story? What do you think could be further explained?|
|Similarly to the previous question, I want to make sure that the visuals are aligned with the storyline.|5. In terms of the visuals, what could be changed to help your understanding of the story?|
|If there's anything that I've added to the story that is surprising or new for those aware of the disease, I want to know so that I can keep these details in the story, as long as they still seem relevant.|6. Is there anything that you’ve learned from the story or found surprising? If so, what?|
|This is the reviewers' opportunity to include any further suggestions they think may help the story if they didn't include it earlier.|7.	Any further suggestions?|


# Interview Findings

| Questions               | Interview 1: Female, early 20s, confirmed PCOS Diagnosis  | Interview 2: Female, mid 20s, confirmed PCOS Diagnosis | Interview 3: Female, late 20s, no PCOS Diagnosis, but aware of the illness |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|1. Do you know what PCOS is, and if so, what is your understanding of the implications of PCOS (there is no need to disclose personal medical details unless you feel comfortable doing so).|I have PCOS, so I had an understanding of the diagnosis even before viewing the project.|I do know what PCOS is, but only learned what it was after receiving a PCOS diagnosis. My understanding is that it will affect my fertility and I am at increased risk of needing to undergo fertility treatments when I decide I want to conceive. My understanding is also that I should maintain an awareness of my diet and exercise regimen to avoid insulin resistance, but losing weight with the condition is difficult. I am also aware that PCOS and its associated fluctuations in hormones affect my energy levels, mood swings, hunger levels, and menstrual cycle.|PCOS is an illness women have where ovaries produce a higher amount of male hormones than what they're supposed to. Implications can be insulin resistance and symptoms include more hair in places not wanted.|
|2. In this storyboard, what did you like or find effective about this wireframe story? Why?|I really liked the interactive breakdown of symptoms by country and the breakdown of diagnoses by race. The visuals conveyed the information really well.|I like the statistics and graphics that show PCOS's prevalence, which effectively help raise awareness of the issue.|The way facts were presented, few words, big fonts and the color red.|
|3. Is there anything you didn’t like. What and why?|N/A|Explain why the BMI and insulin resistance graphic is important. I think something people don't realize is that most people with PCOS are told to just lose weight to lessen their symptoms, but that simply isn't a solution for those who already avg weight. Also, symptoms don't necessarily go away completely for those who do lose weight. I think the patient is often blamed for their ailments when they are overweight but in some cases the illness contributes to the weight gain instead of the other way around.|I didn't like the change of theme color by the middle of the presentation. It started with red, white and black and then it suddenly changed to blue.|
|4.	Is there anything that was confusing about the story? What do you think could be further explained?|The economic burden of PCOS could be more clearly explained following the quote from the National Institutes of Health. It would also be helpful to explain the name of the condition since it often causes a person to immediately think of cysts, but not everyone diagnosed with PCOS has ovarian cysts. This is an especially common misconception (from my experience) because of how the condition is named, so I think it should be mentioned and clarified in the introduction.|I think you should explain further how/or why the illness is "ill-defined" and what that means for patients (you start by explaining different sets of diagnostic criteria and funding, but I'd add that many physicians aren't even trained to diagnose it, it often requires a blood test, an ultrasound, and physical symptoms to diagnose." Also you don't mention treatment till the end which is fine because this is about raising awareness, but I think it's important for people to understand that treatment options are quite limited and usually involve birth control, which has a whole host of other impacts on the body, especially in adolescence when people are typically diagnosed.|The chart of diagnoses by race was kind of confusing because it gives the sense that some of the races in the middle have a higher prevalence when the ones in the bottom are greater. The quantities/measures/units for each race are difficult to compare. It's also difficult to understand the indicators that each race includes (horizontally). There's too much information at the horizontal and vertical levels.|
|5. In terms of the visuals, what could be changed to help your understanding of the story?|The first visual of someone lying on the bed could be changed to something more closely related to the condition.|Not sure if it's too graphic, but a diagram with all the symptoms or of what an polycystic ovary looks like could be helpful for context. Otherwise I think the visuals are great!|I would revise the colors used from the chart of diagnoses by race onwards. Other than that, the topics are clearly explained.|
|6. Is there anything that you’ve learned from the story or found surprising? If so, what?|I really liked seeing the breakdown of PCOS symptoms by country. I had never seen that data before and found the variations surprising!|I didn't know about the countries with the most reported cases!|Not much. I'm very familiar with the topics.|
|7.	Any further suggestions?|I think that the insulin resistance section can be moved up to follow the symptoms section and precede the race section to improve the flow. If the data has this information, it would also be helpful to include insulin resistance and ovarian cysts in the visualization of symptoms by country to see where they rank relative to other symptoms. If possible, it would also be nice to change the colors of a few of the graphs/visuals to match the dominant color scheme of reds, pinks, greys, and blacks. For example, the graphs depicting race and insulin resistance could match the colors of the visual breakdown of symptoms by country.|I think I said it all above.|N/A|

# Feedback from In-Class Peer Review

During the in-class review, my peers gave great feedback regarding the visualizations, and how I could further augment them to help tell my story. In particular, they suggested that I make the color scheme more uniform, and highlight salient points that are aligned with my particular narrative. Regarding my visualizations, my peers suggested that for the chart representing the breakdown of common PCOS symptoms, I make it clearer that the chart can be filtered by the countries in comparison, and to eliminate extraneous detail from the visualization showing the PCOS diagnoses by race. For the visualization showing BMI, similar to the reviewers' feedback, I was told to highlight the importance of a normal to below average BMI, and how the findings contradict the commonly held belief that those diagnosed with PCOS are only overweight, and are often told to simply lose weight as a remedy for their diagnosis. 

# Identified Changes for Part III

Given the feedback I got from my reviewers as well as my peers, I will be implementing a lot of their feedback in order to ensure that I’m telling a well-flowing, authentic, and effective narrative about PCOS. In particular, I will focus on making sure my color scheme is consistent all throughout the presentation to create a more cohesive look. I also have already started resorting some of the sections to ensure that the storyline makes more sense. I will now be focusing on introducing the subject, why it’s an important diagnosis and medical condition to understand, a breakdown of associated symptoms, further medical implications, especially regarding insulin resistance, a breakdown of the racial component and why that’s necessary to highlight in terms of medical research, the prevalence of this diagnosis but lack of funding from public health advocates and the government, which will all culminate in my specific calls to action. 

I have already started implementing the feedback, including thematic cohesion, and more explicit language regarding this misunderstandings of the condition. I will be enhancing the underfunding component by comparing comparable conditions, and funding in comparison to current PCOS funding.
