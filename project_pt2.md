# Wireframes

I decided to make the wireframe outline in Shorthand so I could have a better understanding of how my project is shaping up given the story that I’m trying to present as well as to have more familiarity with the tool. I have used some of the visualizations I presented in Part 1, but I’ve updated them more to flow better with the story, as well as to better represent the data I’ve collected. I realized after Part I that the scope of my story was a little too narrow, so rather than focusing on the effects of PCOS on the South Asian Diaspora, I am now focusing on PCOS in the context of the US, and highlighting that Women+ of color* represent the majority of diagnosed cases in the US. 

*Women+ is to indicate that this condition affects menstruating women and menstruating people who do not identify with the gender binary.

# User Research

## Target Audience
The intended audience for this storyboard is predominantly those of menstruating age who may be dealing with many of the identified symptoms but aren’t currently diagnosed or are diagnosed but are unaware of the potential further medical implications beyond infertility. Many of us who are diagnosed are simply told that infertility is the biggest concern when it comes to a PCOS diagnosis, but aren’t necessarily aware that there’s a propensity toward insulin resistance. 

I decided to reach out to people I know who have either been diagnosed with PCOS or have heard of PCOS to get the range of understanding regarding the visual story. For those who have been diagnosed with PCOS, it was important to me to get their feedback regarding both the authenticity of the story told as well as anything that they might not necessarily know about their diagnosis. For those who have heard of PCOS but either don’t have a diagnosis or are unfamiliar with the illness beyond the basics, I wanted to get their interpretations of the visualizations, and whether they found anything confusing or surprising? 


# Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|I want to understand how their understanding or personal experience with PCOS may influence how they view this topic.| 1. Do you know what PCOS is, and if so, what is your understanding of the implications of PCOS (there is no need to disclose personal medical details unless you feel comfortable doing so).|
|Considering their background, I trust these reviewers to give their honest opinion about how effective they find the narrative, or what is true to their experience. |2. In this storyboard, what did you like or find effective about this wireframe story? Why?|
|Similarly to the previous question, if I'm narrating a story that represents a part of my reviewers, I want to make sure the story and facts are correct and representative of them.|3. Is there anything you didn’t like. What and why?|
|For narrative's sake, I want to make sure that the storyline and the supporting evidence flow well and makes sense to any audience.|4.	Is there anything that was confusing about the story? What do you think could be further explained?|
|Similarly to the previous question, I want to make sure that the visuals are aligned with the storyline.|5. In terms of the visuals, what could be changed to help your understanding of the story?|
|If there's anything that I've added to the story that is surprising or new for those aware of the disease, I want to know so that I can keep these details in the story, as long as they still seem relevant.|6. Is there anything that you’ve learned from the story or found surprising? If so, what?|
|This is the reviewers' opportunity to include any further suggestions they think may help the story if they didn't include it earlier|7.	Any further suggestions?|
