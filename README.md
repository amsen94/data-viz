This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data.

# About Me
My name is Ahana, and my pronouns are she/her. I'm a second year Public Policy and Management Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University. I worked in the non-profit performing arts space for about four years prior to joining my master's program. My experience is predominantly in marketing, development, and board management. 

At CMU, I've been working to sharpen my data and analytical tools to ensure I have a well-rounded toolbelt for policy concerns. In particular, I am interested in policy focused on issues of affordable housing, mental health and resources for unhoused individuals, and gender policy focusing on economic development and financial empowerment for women.  

# What I Hope to Learn
I worked in marketing for a non-profit organization for a few years, and worked extensively with graphic designers and web designers there. Through them I understood how powerful graphics can be as a tool for communication, context, and insight. Throughout my time here at CMU, we've been inundated with more graphic representations of data than I could have imagined, whether it be an economic model or an infographic for public health safety. Some graphics are easier to interpret than others, and as such, I want to be able to create useful graphics that may help my audience interpret results or data more easily than simply showing them numbers.

I also want to be able to build my data visualization vocabulary for the future. I may not necessarily be the person who creates the graphics on whatever team I work on in the future, but I may be requesting that the graphic designer on the team create an image that can enhance our work and results. I would like to learn the language of the subject so that I can be clear and explicit with any directives in the future.
