# Data Visualization Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data.

# About Me
My name is Ahana Sen, and my pronouns are she/her. I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Public Policy and Management from Carnegie Mellon University. I worked in the non-profit performing arts space for over four years prior to joining my master's program. My experience is primarily in project management, donor stewardship and fundraising, and strategic engagement. 

At CMU, I gained qualitative and quantitative analytical tools to ensure I have a well-rounded toolbelt for policy analysis and evaluation. In particular, I am interested in policy focused on equitable outcomes for affected communities, especially regarding affordable housing, public health, and racial/gender disparities.  

# What I've Learned
Data visualization is a powerful tool that can influence policy and business decisions. At CMU, we were inundated with more graphic representations of data than I could have imagined, whether it was an economic model or an infographic for public health safety. Some visualizations are easier to interpret than others, and as such, I learned the power of harnessing data to create visualizations that may help my audience interpret results or data more easily than simply showing them numbers.

My portfolio highlights my ability to simplify complex data, showcase data-driven insights, communicate policy implications, and hopefully facilitate public engagement. My projects are linked below.
